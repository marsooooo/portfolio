        <h2>Stinger Transition</h2>
        <p>Short animations made on Adobe After Effects. Mostly used in content creation to create a smooth transition between two scenes. This is something I like to do on my free time, I learned animation and graphic design at a young age and even though I am more into programming now i still like to add some in my web projects</p>
